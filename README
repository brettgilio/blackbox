Blackbox GNU/Linux-libre
========================

Blackbox GNU/Linux-libre is a distribution of GNU/Linux derived from
the Guix & Nix configuration languages and package managers. This
project is an on-going fork of GNU Guix that may be either installed
using a separate ISO, or on-top of your current Guix System
configuration. Blackbox is designed for software engineers,
mathematicians, and ethical hackers to provide an OOTB environment for
various projects. Unlike Guix, Blackbox is an opinionated distribution
that strives to provide as much up-front to the hacker, with initially
little to configure unless you ultimately desire to make changes.

1. Contributing
===============

The primary Blackbox GNU/Linux repository is currently hosted at
[https://git.sr.ht/~brettgilio/blackbox], but is also mirrored at
[https://github.com/brettgilio/blackbox]. The GitHub mirror is a read-only
repository for people to view, no contributions will be accepted from that
medium. Like GNU Guix, this project uses a Git-by-email patch method for
submitting and tracking changes to the source tree. While appreciated,
contributions in the form of pull requests are not going to be merged.

More information on how to contribute will be added at a later date.
