Blackbox
========

[Scheme] [Emacs Lisp] [Common Lisp] [C] [Haskell] [Nix]

Blackbox is a distribution configuration based on the Guix System Configuration
Language, and the Guix/Nix package managers. The goal of this project is to
maintain compatability with the system distribution of GNU Guix, allowing you to
install Blackbox as a superficial layer on-top of the standard Guix
upstream. Blackbox is designed to provide you with an OOTB working hackable
system designed for software engineers, mathematicians, and ethical hackers of
many varieties.

1. Contributing
===============

The primary Blackbox GNU/Linux repository is currently hosted at
[https://git.sr.ht/~brettgilio/blackbox], but is also mirrored at
[https://github.com/brettgilio/blackbox]. The GitHub mirror is a read-only
repository for people to view, no contributions will be accepted from that
medium. Like GNU Guix, this project uses a Git-by-email patch method for
submitting and tracking changes to the source tree. While appreciated,
contributions in the form of pull requests are not going to be merged.

More information on how to contribute will be added at a later date.
